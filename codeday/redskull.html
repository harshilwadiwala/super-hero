             <p>  The Red Skull (Johann Shmidt) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and its predecessor Timely Comics. In Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), the Red Skull's secret identity was revealed to be George Maxon. It would be retroactively established that Maxon was merely a decoy for Johann Shmidt. Albert Malik would later adopt the mantle of the Red Skull, only to be killed in a plot orchestrated by Shmidt.      </p>
